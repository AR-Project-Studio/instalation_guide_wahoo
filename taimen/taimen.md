## Installation Guide for Android 14 on Google Pixel 2XL (Taimen)

### Basic requirements
1. Read through the instructions at least once before actually following them, so as to avoid any problems due to any missed steps!
2. Make sure your computer has adb and fastboot
3. Enable USB debugging on your device
4. Boot your device with the stock OS at least once and check every functionality. Make sure that you can send and receive SMS and place and receive calls (also via WiFi and LTE, if available)

### Unlocking the bootloader
1. Enable OEM unlock in the Developer options under device Settings, if present
2. Connect the device to your PC via USB
3. On the computer, open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Linux or macOS) window, and type:
```
adb reboot bootloader
```
   - You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination with the device powered off, hold Volume Down + Power
4. Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:
```
fastboot devices
```
   If you get any output or an error:
   - on Windows: make sure the device appears in the device manager without a triangle. Try other drivers until the command above works!
   - on Linux or macOS: If you see no permissions fastboot try running fastboot as root. When the output is empty, check your USB cable and port!
5. Now type the following command to unlock the bootloader:
```
fastboot flashing unlock
```
6. If the device doesn’t automatically reboot, reboot it. It should now be unlocked.
7. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable USB debugging to continue.

### Repartition
Specially for build provided by AR Project Studio, you must repartition again your device. If you have repartitioned with PixelExperience partition, well you just need to flash the new repart file, no need back to the stock partition again. But if you want to make all clean, you can do back to the stock patition firts then repart again.
